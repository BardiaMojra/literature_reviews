The paper introduces an autonomous framework for object 3D scanning using a robotic arm and depth camera. The authors have put considerable effort into designing and building the system. Moreover, they provide a detailed description of their work, which is generally appreciated by the research community.

I would consider this submission a fair conference paper if there more theoretical contributions. This could be the source code, a dataset, or an algorithm pseudo-code. I believe the authors are able to make such contributions, but it is not provided in the paper in its current form.
